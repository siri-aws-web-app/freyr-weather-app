# Freyr Weather App

The Freyr Weather App was written in about 5-7 days. It is not responisve as it wasnt really the focus of my project (Terraform and AWS was), But I hope it did the job to show that I'm not too shabby with the frontend.

## Features

- **Svelte and SvelteKit**: Utilizing the latest technologies for a seamless, reactive user experience. I'm a trendy boy.
- **TypeScript**: Ensuring type safety and scalable code management across the application.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development without leaving your HTML.
- **Skeleton UI**: Provides a smooth UI library that is completely configurable with Tailwind.
- **Automated Deployment**: Release-based deployment workflows that cater to different environments based on the release tag suffix (`-dev`, `-stag`, or no suffix for production).

Unfortunately, there is no implemention for a www. domain as I did not set it up. Again, due to lack of time it was just not feasible, but hey, at least i did the https and SSL connection right?
